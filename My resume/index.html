        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Chitraksh Vasantati, a sophomore computer science undergraduate with a passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence(AI).<br>
            I actively engage in projects related to Machine Learning, Arduino programming, and app development to solidify my understanding and practical skills.<br>
            My ultimate goal is to become a leading expert in AI and Machine Learning, and leverage this knowledge in my future career.<br>            
            I aspire to pursue a graduate degree in Data Science at a top university or secure a position at a leading multinational corporation (MNC) focused on AI and Machine Learning.
            However, I also hold a strong entrepreneurial spirit and envision starting my own company one day.<br>
